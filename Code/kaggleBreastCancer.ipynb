    "# Machine Learning on Breast Cancer Diagnosis  \n",
    "\n",
    "Hi friends, let's do some machine learning on breast cancer diagnosis. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to build a few classifiers for breast cancer diagnosis, a ***catgorical*** outcome variable, based on ***continous*** predictors, using the *Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set* downloaded from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following script, you can expect to learn: <br>\n",
    "- Data cleaning and visualizaiton techniques that are critical to modeling building\n",
    "- Basic machine learning pipe-line \n",
    "- AutoML demonstration\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that machine learning is just a ***tool***, not magic. <br>\n",
    "Nothing can replace an important research question inspired by your daily observations and experiences.<br>\n",
    "You also need to understand your data well to know its potentials and limitations. <br>\n",
    "Finally, you can use machine learning to help you answer a realistic question that your data is capable to answer. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyways, let's get going and start our practice. "
